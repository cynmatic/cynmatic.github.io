        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Mechanical EngineeringðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Cynthia Martinez and I'm looking into getting a
        job in the mechanical engineering field I'm currently an Undeclared major at UCR.
        My love for physics started when I took a physics class in high school. After that, 
        I fell in love with physics especially the astronomical side which then later I took
        a class in my first quarter at UC Riverside. <br><br>

        Being a Riverside local has come with 
        great experiences that have definitely shaped my future and have gotten me to the point
        in my life for which I am currently in. I was born in Moreno Valley, California, and
        spent most of my life in Southern California, I then moved to Menifee, California.
        Unfortunately, due to the 2009 crisis, I had to move to Perris, California where I
        attended a school called Heritage High School at this point in time, I did not want to
        go to college. I absolutely had no desire to further expand my education however with
        the encouragement of many teachers I learned that to survive in society much of the 
        money I desired to make was only achievable with a college degree. I then took STEM classes
        at my high school which sparked my interest in pursuing a career in Mechanical Engineering.
        Now at the ripe age of 19, I'm currently struggling to turn my life around and pursue a
        mechanical engineering degree. Due to the fact that I didn't take college algebra in
        high school taking math at UCR is quite difficult so I plan to do an extension and take
        math classes over the summer at my local Community College MSJC where I previously took
        three college courses throughout my high school years.  the college courses consisted of 
        History, criminology, and college-ready success.  bunch of my time in high school I worked
        very hard and advanced classes like AP psychology ap art and AP Spanish four. <br><br>

        I grew up speaking Spanish and English is my second language. This has benefited me in the long run 
        since I live in a primarily Latin community.  Being bilingual has come to my advantage during
        work which I currently work as an avid tutor at Paloma Valley High School. However, being an
        avatar wasn't my only work experience in the past I have worked at schools but it wasn't 
        necessarily working, I volunteered on the weekends for STEM activities where I helped children 
        collaborate and express themselves creatively through arts and building projects. Many of 
        these kids were small children and as previously mentioned being in a Latin Community many 
        of these kids only spoke Spanish. Being a Spanish speaker has allowed me to let these children
        express themselves comfortably without the fear of them having to speak English which is our 
        normal language in elementary school! With my native tongue has come amazing benefits and I am 
        more than happy to apply this skill in further job in the future
